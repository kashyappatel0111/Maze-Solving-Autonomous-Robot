# Maze-Solving-Autonomous-Robot
Designed and built an autonomous maze-solving robot using an ESP32, ultrasonic sensor, and L298N motor driver. The system detects obstacles in real time, makes navigation decisions, and controls differential steering to move smoothly and efficiently through complex maze layouts.
