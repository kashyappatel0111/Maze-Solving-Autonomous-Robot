# 🤖 Autonomous Maze-Solving Robot Using ESP32

This project is an **autonomous 4-wheel maze solver robot** built using an **ESP32**, **L298N motor driver**, and **ultrasonic sensors**.  
The robot detects walls, makes navigation decisions, and solves mazes **without any manual control**.

## 🔧 Hardware Used

- ESP32 Development Board  
- L298N Motor Driver  
- 4 × DC Motors (4-wheel chassis)  
- HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensors (Front, Left, Right)  
- 6 × 1.2V Ni-MH Battery Pack  
- Jumper wires / chassis / common ground setup

## 🛠 Working Principle

The ESP32 continuously reads distances from ultrasonic sensors.  
Based on wall detection, the robot decides:

- **Move Forward** when path is clear  
- **Turn Left / Turn Right** when a wall is detected  
- **Stop** when required  
- Follow **wall-following maze algorithm** until exit is reached

The L298N controls the motor directions as decided by the algorithm.
